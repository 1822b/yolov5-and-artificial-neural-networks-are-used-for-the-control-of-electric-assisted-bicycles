#Intelligent control system for electric-assist bicycles based on neural networks and machine vision
This project is mainly used for installing brushless DC motors controlled by pwm in the motor drive module of electric-assisted bicycles
A neural network is trained using data generated by fuzzy control to optimize motor control strategies, while an improved YOLOv5-lite algorithm enables real-time detection of vehicles and pedestrians, enhancing environmental perception.  By combining the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks with the perceptual strengths of machine vision, the system achieves intelligent responses to complex nonlinear scenarios.
